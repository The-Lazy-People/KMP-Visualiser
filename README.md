Welcome to KMP visualiser!! </br>

## All about KMP-Visualiser
- It helps in understanding, the working of KMP Algorithm.
- User needs to add a source string and a target string.
- This algorithm helps in searching the target string in the source string.
- Yellow color in the source string depicts that the target string is found.
- Red color depicts comparision between each letter of the two strings.
- Target String moves with the source string to visualise algorithm effectively.


## KMP Algorithm
- In computer science, the Knuth–Morris–Pratt string-searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.
- Time Complexity is O(n).
